update v1.4 11/11/2024
- added support for webgl shaders using extension .gls
- added generate m3u by searching on one tag
  artist, title, album, genre and year
  slideshow <audiosource> <tag> <tagquery>
  example: slideshow.exe g:\data\mp3\classic artist beethoven
  generates the m3u file beethoven.m3u
  which then can be played by slideshow.exe beethoven.m3u
  notes:
  * simple search so 195 is equivelant of ?195? or *195*
  * runtime in seconds is not calculated default is #EXTINF:134
  * no explicit wildcard support
